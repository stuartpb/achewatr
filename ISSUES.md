# Known Issues

- The styles of the elements of the achewatr nav are not fully protected from the stylesheet applied for blogs, so for instance Chris' blog posts cause the nav images to be block displayed and the links to be bold.
- the Previous/Next logic is kind of messed up with regards to things with simultaneous publication dates: see http://achewatr.jit.su/achewood/date/06152004
- The encoding is wrong (as it is in the source material) on http://achewatr.jit.su/raysplace/date/06242005

## Won't Fix

- All the Ray's Place HTML is cleaned up in the crawling process, meaning view-source:http://achewatr.jit.su/raysplace/date/02162004 can't perfectly capture Ray's ineptitude with HTML as view-source:http://www.achewood.com/raysplace.php?date=02162004&allnav=1 .

There is no technology to guard against this.
