# Known Issues

- The styles of the elements of the achewatr nav are not fully protected from the stylesheet applied for blogs, so for instance Chris' blog posts cause the nav images to be block displayed and the links to be bold.
- the Previous/Next logic is kind of messed up: see http://achewatr.jit.su/achewood/date/06152004
