NOTE: Epoch data for this data set was calculated on a Windows 7 system on Pacific time, with its rules with regards to Daylight Savings Time. If you are running this script on another system with a different locale or otherwise different interpretation rules for dates, you will need to regenerate the data, or the dates in your output will be slightly off. There is no technology to guard against this.
